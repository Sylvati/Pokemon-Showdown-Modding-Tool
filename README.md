# WARNING

This tool is not created for profit. If you paid for this tool in any way, get your money back. I do not intend to infringe any copyrights and am creating this project with the sole intention of emboldening the Pokemon fangame community.

# Inspiration

I was playing Pokemon Odyssey and wanted to build a team. Unfortunately showdown does not hae fakemon, so I tried to make my own mod with a little success. This made me realize that every rom-hack should either have a teambuilding tool like Showdown or be very easy to make a teambuilding tool for.

# Goal

To become a modding tool that allows fangame creators to utilize Pokemon Showdown's battling system to allow for fangames outside of the rom hacking scene.

## Planned milestones:
1. Modding tool to modify Pokemon Showdown to allow for easy fakemon creation. 

A common them in Pokemon fangames is fakemon. While this feature is technically unnecessary as fangames without fakemon exist, the original idea was rooted in adding fakemon to showdown.

2. Visualization into game engines.

If Pokemon Showdown with fakemon can be used in game engines, then people can make creative fangames without worrying about the complex battle logic. This removes a significant coding barrier and will hopefully make others who want to design crazy things like 3D fangames or fangames with entirely custom artstyles inspired to create despite a lack of coding knowledge.

3. Easy visualization editing / headless battles.

This is quite a bit more complicated. This would mean letting people edit the client itself so they can choose how to visualize the battles. The problem here isn't that its actually that difficult and moreso that it's just a large problem. There are so many effects in Pokemon. Ideally the Pokemon Showdown client is the fallback, but I'm not entirely sure how to do this right now.

## Other milestones:

1. Making the other parts of fangame creation easier.

This is a catch-all goal to represent the rest. You'll see what I mean

2. Have random encounters be data-driven so people can create them with no code.

This would allow for csv files which are very human readable and editable to be the main way developers interact with random encounters.

3. Other systems be data-driven

Think the inventory and player already existing. The ideal goal of this is to have a drop-in framework that is entirely customizable. 

# Note

I will be primarily working with Godot as I believe it is the future. However, I recognize it has its issues and I will try to make this compatible with Unity. I cannot make any promises about Unreal support though, because I haven't ever worked with it. I know C++ though so it probably wouldn't be the most impossible thing ever.

# Protections

I will not include any assets that are not already bundled with Pokemon Showdown. Nintendo seems to be okay with Showdown, so I plan on using that to my advantage.

Please do not profit from any Nintendo assets that you do not own the copyrights to. I am not a lawyer and can't speak on this any further.

This tool is not affiliated with Smogon or Pokemon Showdown.

# Contributions

I am currently developing this as a solo project, but by all means feel free to leave suggestions or even fix my code. I know this is an extremely ambitious project and any help would be greatly appreciated! This will remain open source.
